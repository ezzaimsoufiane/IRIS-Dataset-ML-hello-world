# Machine Learning : Hello World

Folling around with the IRIS Dataset, because why not.
Using scikit-learn & Keras for classifying Iris flower.

## Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset is a database containing 3 types of iris plant with 50 instances each. Each instances has four attributes of the flower namely sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width. The three known types of iris are setosa, versicolor and virginica. These classes of iris will be classified according to the dimensions of their petal and sepal. This dataset is regarded as the most popular dataset to practice machine learning and even deep learning because of how easy it is to classify the flower.

## Algorithms:
K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Classification, Random Forest, Neural Nets.
